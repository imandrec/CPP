								NOTE
			Please dont try to change the  name of c files else make file will not be able to execute or compile the code


Execution Instruction:
                      You can execute the code with the help of the make file after the compilation of code by simply writing the "make" keyword on the terminal.
                      after this, you need to use the command "make SingleThread_exe" if you want to execute the SingleThread program and for the MultiThread program you need to write "make MultiThread_exe"
                      Please make sure one thing that if you are willing to execute the code with make file tags then you must need to create a file with the name "input.txt" in the same directory where you are executing the code.

Restrictions:
             Both programs can read 5000 integers from the file.
             Please make sure that the file should consist of just integer values instead of float and double or any else data type.

MultiThread Program:
                    IN the multithreading program I'm using 3 threads that help us to speed up the computations time.
                    the first thread will explore (0 to size/3) elements of the array
                    second thread will explore (size/3 to (size/3) * 2) elements of the array
                    Last thread will explore ((size/3) * 2 to size) elements of the array
